  "content": "Freddy's Job\nReviewer: Tony Leung\nLength: 106 mins\nCategory: I\n\nFreddy's Job is American filmmaker Joe Leung's latest production. This work of his is a comedy filmed in Hong Kong combined with animated animals. The film is about Freddy's adventures at Charlie's Sweets, a famous chocolate factory. Freddy is a guard dog there. One night, he meets a cat called Fatty, some thieves and a girl at a factory...\n\nThe funniest part of the film is when Freddy first meets Fatty the big white cat. Their conversation is funny. Together, they think of a clever plan to catch the thieves. The chase is exciting and the music matches perfectly with the scenes.\n\nActors Carrie White and Jason Brown are great as usual. The main character — the dog that plays Freddy — is smart and lovely. In fact, that was why I went to watch this film in the first place.\n\nAlthough I had a good laugh, I think the film is too long. I think the last fifteen minutes is a bit boring. Apart from that, Freddy's Job is creative, funny, and worth watching. It is a film that children will enjoy."
