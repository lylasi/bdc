  "content": "The Wrong Train\n\nLast week, Aunt Annie came to Hong Kong for vacation. She stayed in a hotel in Hung Hom. We invited her to have dinner at our home in Kwun Tong. Dad said he would drive her but she wanted to take public transport. She moved to Toronto 12 years ago and this was the first time she had returned since she left. She wanted to know what Hong Kong is like now.\n\nAunt Annie planned to take the bus at first. She waited for a long time but the bus didn't come, so she caught a minibus to Mong Kok instead. Aunt Annie then took the MTR. She met an old friend at the station. They chatted so happily that she didn't realise she took the wrong line.\n\nWhen she got off at Mei Foo station, she wanted to call us but she found that she forgot to bring her phone. Aunt Annie was worried because it was getting late. Suddenly, she saw a taxi and jumped in it immediately. She finally arrived at our home at 9 p.m. She said, 'Taxis in Canada are so expensive that I seldom take them. I totally forgot about this option! Ha ha!'"
