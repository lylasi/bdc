  "content": "Why eat pasta?\n\nPasta is a food made from flour. It is a major part of Italian cuisine. Pasta is a healthy food â€” it is a source of carbohydrate. Like bread and rice, pasta is a main source of your energy. It is also a good source of iron, vitamins and minerals, which are all necessary for good health.\n\nDo you know there are nearly 400 different types of pasta, with interesting, beautiful shapes and names? Apart from spaghetti, which we are familiar with, there is linguine which is flat spaghetti. Some pasta is short, like penne, which looks like a tube. Fusilli looks like a spiral or a spring and farfalle looks like a pretty butterfly or bow.\n\nMany delicious recipes use pasta because pasta goes well with many different sauces and ingredients. Some famous recipes include pasta with tomato sauce and carbonara which is a ham and cream sauce. You just have to explore different possibilities and use your creativity when planning a pasta dish!\n\nRecommended daily serving for children\n\nChildren aged up to 10 years old should eat five servings of carbohydrates each day. One serving is a small bowl of rice, pasta or cereals."
