I can't decide. I like Germany because the castles and palaces are beautiful. I also enjoyed the activities in England. My dream was to visit my favourite football club and I did that! I also watched an exciting tennis match at Wimbledon in London. Those were amazing experiences.\nKaren: Where would you like to go next?\nTommy: I would like to visit Australia because there are kangaroos and koalas. My uncle who lives in Sydney also told me that the beaches there are beautiful. I want to go swimming there. But I don't think I will go there this year because my family is planning a trip to Tokyo. My sisters want to go shopping and my dad loves the food there! I'm looking forward to going to the theme park most because I love riding roller coasters.\nKaren: When do you usually travel?\nTommy: We like to travel in August because my sisters and I don't have to go to school. We can have a longer vacation."
