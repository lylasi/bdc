  "content": "Some jobs require special types of clothes and accessories, for example, a firefighter. A firefighter is a person who puts out fires. This job is very dangerous and therefore firefighters must wear special protective uniforms.\n\nWhen firefighters put out a fire, they wear full gear. These include a jacket and trousers. They are made of fireproof material to reflect heat. These clothes have reflective stripes on the waist, arms and legs. These bars glow in the dark, which helps other firefighters see them in heavy smoke.\n\nThey wear gloves and boots that are also fireproof and waterproof. Helmets protect their heads from fire, heat and falling objects. Helmets can be fitted with a torch.\n\nThey also wear a special belt. This belt carries important tools such as an axe. If a fire is big and smoky, they can wear another piece of equipment to help them breathe. These are air tanks which are carried on their backs. Firefighters can then breathe through a mask which protects their eyes and face.\n\nFirefighters need these clothing items and equipment to protect them when saving people from fire."
