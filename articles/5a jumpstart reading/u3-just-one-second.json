I hurt my shoulder two months ago so I had to stop training for a while. I was worried that my injury would affect my performance but it didn't. I have to thank my coach and doctor for taking good care of me.\n\nI was in front for half the race but in the last 10 metres, my legs got tired so I slowed down. Mary touched the wall just before me. Her finish time was 35 seconds and mine was one second slower. Although I did not win, I was still happy with my results because I broke my own record! My parents jumped and cheered for me too.\n\nAt the end of the swimming gala, some parents dived in the pool to have a race too. We cheered Peggy's dad on, but he came last. He's unfit because he hasn't exercised for a long time. The swimming gala ended at 5 p.m.\n\nMum and Dad were so proud of me that they took me for pizza and ice cream later that evening to celebrate. It was a wonderful day."
