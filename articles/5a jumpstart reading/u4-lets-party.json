But we're still thinking about what to buy. What present will you give him this year?\nLisa: I bought a toy car. I also plan to give him some cookies. It's a different recipe from last year so I hope they are softer this time. By the way, how will you get to the venue? Is the restaurant near the MTR station?\nKitty: Yes, it's just opposite our school. What time are you going? The party starts at 10 a.m.\nLisa: I have a piano lesson in the morning so I'll be late. But I'll arrive at noon because I don't want to miss the magic show.\nKitty: I'll arrive on time. I wonder what cake we will have this year. Last year, it was shaped like a rocket. It was awesome!\nLisa: I think it might be in the shape of Maxi this year because Ken loves that robot so much!\nKitty: Really? Thanks, Lisa. I know what to buy for Ken now. Ha ha!"
