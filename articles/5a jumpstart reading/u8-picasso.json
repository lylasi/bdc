  "content": "Pablo Picasso was one of the most famous artists in the twentieth century. His style of painting was very special and different from the classic style. Some of his well-known artworks include Three Musicians and Girl Before a Mirror.\n\nPicasso was born in Spain in 1881. His father was an artist who liked to paint birds. When Picasso was seven, he had his first art lesson from his father. By the age of 13, his father realised that Picasso had already become a better artist than him. He decided to send Picasso to an art school in Madrid on his own when he was only 16.\n\nIn 1900, Picasso went to Paris to learn more about art. Sadly, his works didn't make any money at first so he was very poor. Luckily, his talent was later discovered and he started to earn money.\n\nPicasso had two marriages. In 1918, he married Olga Khokhlova. Picasso met her when he was designing ballet costumes for a ballet company. Olga was one of the ballerinas. In 1961, Picasso married his second wife, Jacqueline Roque.\n\nPicasso died in France in 1973 at the age of 91. Throughout his life, he produced over 50,000 pieces of artwork. A lot of his works are displayed in museums in Europe."
