  "content": "Sleep is a vital, often neglected, component of every person's overall health and well-being. Sleep is important because it enables the body to repair and be fit and ready for another day. Getting enough quality sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety.\n\nDuring sleep, your brain is working to form new pathways for learning and memory. If you are sleep deficient, you might have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling your emotions and behavior, and coping with change. Sleep deficiency has also been linked to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior.\n\nFor a healthy heart, it is important to get enough sleep. Sleep plays a vital role in your ability to heal and repair your blood vessels and heart. Ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke."
