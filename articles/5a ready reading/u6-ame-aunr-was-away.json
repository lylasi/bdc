  "content": "This morning, Karen's uncle told her cousins, 'Your mum will come back home tomorrow. There's a lot of housework to do before she gets home. Can you help? I've made a list.'\n\n'Can I help too?' asked Karen. 'Sure! Karen, which would you like to do, vacuum the rug or wash the dishes?' asked her cousin Ray. 'I'd like to wash the dishes,' replied Karen. 'OK. Let me vacuum the rug,' said Ray.\n\nKaren was washing the dishes in the kitchen. Clack! Clack! 'Be careful!' said Karen's uncle. 'Don't break the dishes.'\n\nRay vacuumed the rug in the sitting room. Crash! He hit the bookcase and all the books fell onto the floor. Karen and her uncle helped him put the books back on the shelves.\n\nKaren's other cousin Eva started to wash the clothes, but she put in too much washing powder and a lot of bubbles came out of the washing machine! Ray and his father helped her clean the floor.\n\nIn the afternoon, they were still busy. Karen asked, 'I've already hung the washing. What should I do now, Uncle?' Her uncle replied, 'Have you and Eva walked the dog yet?' Karen replied, 'No, we haven't walked Bobo yet. I've just fed him.'\n\n'Eva has just done the grocery shopping. Let us do it now.'\n\nIt was seven o'clock in the evening. 'Oops! There's no water supply and I can't cook the meal. Let's order a takeaway. Which would you like to have for dinner, pizza or chicken wings?' asked Karen's uncle.\n\n'I'd like to have pizza!' replied Ray.\n\nSuddenly, someone opened the door. 'Surprise! I missed you all, so I came home one day earlier. Have you had dinner yet? I've just bought a big pizza and some pasta for you!' said Karen's aunt. 'We missed you too!' Karen and her cousins shouted happily."
