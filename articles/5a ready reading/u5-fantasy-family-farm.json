You can try all of these at Fantasy Family Farm!\n\nOn our farm, you can pick fruit from our apple trees. We get milk from cows and eggs from chickens, but they need food too! Feed our animals and keep them healthy. Learn how to make bread, soap and candles like people did in the past. You can take home anything which you make!\n\nThere is time to play too! You can ride a horse in our grassy green fields or row a boat on our beautiful blue lake. If you want to play among the terrific tall trees, we have a tree house and a rope course. If sport is what you want, you can even play golf.\n\nMake plans now to enjoy an exciting educational experience at Fantasy Family Farm!\n\nA very special guest\n\nLast month, we welcomed our 10,000th visitor!
