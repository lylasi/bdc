## Code Style and Conventions

Based on a detailed analysis of `app.js`, the project follows these conventions:

- **Structure**: The code is organized into logical sections using comments (Global Variables, DOM Elements, Initialization, Feature Functions, etc.). This makes the large file more manageable.
- **Naming**: Variable and function names are descriptive and use camelCase (e.g., `vocabularyBooks`, `renderVocabBookList`). DOM element variables are consistently named, often suffixed with `Btn`, `List`, `Container`, etc. (e.g., `addVocabBookBtn`, `vocabBookList`).
- **Modularity**: Functions are generally kept focused on a single responsibility (e.g., `saveVocabularyBooks`, `renderWordList`, `startDictation`). This promotes reusability and easier maintenance.
- **State Management**: State is managed via global variables at the top of the file (e.g., `vocabularyBooks`, `activeBookId`, `quizInProgress`). Persistence is handled by serializing these variables to `localStorage`.
- **DOM Manipulation**: The application directly manipulates the DOM using standard Web APIs like `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, and `element.addEventListener`. There is no use of a Virtual DOM library (like React or Vue).
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Asynchronous tasks, especially API calls to the AI service, are handled using `async/await` syntax within `try...catch` blocks for robust error handling.
- **Event Handling**: A centralized `setupEventListeners()` function is used to attach all event listeners on page load. Some event delegation is used on parent containers (e.g., `vocabBookList`) to handle events for dynamically created child elements.
- **Configuration**: Sensitive or environment-specific values like API keys and URLs are intended to be stored in a separate `ai-config.js` file, which is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- **Error Handling**: `try...catch` blocks are used for network requests and JSON parsing to prevent application crashes and provide user feedback (e.g., via `alert()`).
